# System requirements

This code has been implemented in Matlab 2023b, using EEGLAB (2021.0) and Fieldtrip (2023-12-20). 

# Instructions

To run the scripts, open Matlab and add the additional_functions folder to the path 

Use pattern_similarity_analysis.m to reproduce the contrast-based pattern similarity results

Use DNNs.m to compute time-frequency resolved model fits 

For network visualizations, use stim_repres_DNNs.m

# Demo

To compute model fits based on time-frequency power data of one example subject, load example_data.dat into matlab and run example_subject_fits.m
